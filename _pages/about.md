I am a postdoctoral research fellow in the Methods group at the [Functional Imaging Laboratory](fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk) at UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology, working with [Dr. Peter Zeidman](https://peterzeidman.co.uk/), [Prof. Karl Friston](https://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/~karl/) and the [Memory and Space team](https://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/team/memory-space-team/) led by [Prof. Eleanor Maguire](https://profiles.ucl.ac.uk/9569-eleanor-maguire). I develop new statistical methods to help neuroscientists answer hypotheses from their neurorimaging data. My main focus is extending [Dynamic Causal Modelling](http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Dynamic_causal_modeling) to relate cortical and behavioral responses to experimental variance during naturalistic experiments. I also contribute to the development of [SPM software](https://github.com/spm).

My interests include Bayesian statistics, causal inference, dynamical systems, adaptive behavior, specifically (but non-exhaustively): 
 - how to relate cortical computations to the updates of internal beliefs or of their precision
 - how to link these updates to behavioral responses or to changes in the experimental setting,
 - how to leverage foundation models to analyse the rich experimental content in naturalistic neuroimaging.
 

## Teaching
I teach neuroimaging methods during the bi-annual [SPM Courses](https://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/course/london/) in London. 

I am also involved in the Dynamic Causal Modelling workshop within the MSc Advanced Neuroimaging program at UCL.
 
## Training
I did my PhD in the [Interactive Digital Human team](https://www.lirmm.fr/teams-en/idh-en/) at the [LIRMM](https://www.lirmm.fr/), under [Dr. Sofiane Ramdani](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=sf56cFwAAAAJ) and [Prof. Abderrahmane Kheddar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=yd4xmlcAAAAJ). I received my MSc in Engineering from [INSA Toulouse](https://www.insa-toulouse.fr/en/), with a focus on Computer Science for Critical Systems.
