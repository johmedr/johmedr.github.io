I am a postdoctoral research fellow at the [Functional Imaging Laboratory](fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk) currently working on developping new Bayesian methods for neuroimaging with [Dr. Peter Zeidman](https://peterzeidman.co.uk/), [Prof. Karl Friston](https://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/~karl/), and the [Memory and Space team](https://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/team/memory-space-team/) led by [Prof. Eleanor Maguire](https://profiles.ucl.ac.uk/9569-eleanor-maguire). 

My long-term goal is to improve our ability to explain complex biological phenomenas. This entails: 

  * extending dynamic causal modelling, a Bayesian framework for modelling dynamical systems, to new experimental paradigms (e.g., naturalistic experiments), new imaging modalities, and new biophysical systems,  
  * improving our understanding of biophysical dynamics under an information-theoretic perspective, using synergetics and the free-energy principle as guiding principles to inspect self-organisation, agency, and adaptation, 
  * developping a rigorous methodology to connect the dots between different physical scales and understand how physical coupling and individual dynamics give rise to the measured collective behaviour.


## Teaching
I teach neuroimaging methods during the bi-annual [SPM Courses](https://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/course/london/) in London. 

I am also involved in the Dynamic Causal Modelling workshop within the MSc Advanced Neuroimaging program at UCL.
 
## Training
I did my PhD in the [Interactive Digital Human team](https://www.lirmm.fr/teams-en/idh-en/) at the [LIRMM](https://www.lirmm.fr/), under [Dr. Sofiane Ramdani](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=sf56cFwAAAAJ) and [Prof. Abderrahmane Kheddar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=yd4xmlcAAAAJ). I received my MSc (*Diplôme d'Ingénieur*) in Control Engineering and Electronics from [INSA Toulouse](https://www.insa-toulouse.fr/en/).
