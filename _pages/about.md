I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at the [ICoN Center at MiT](https://yangtan.mit.edu/icon/) and an Honorary Research Fellow at the [Functional Imaging Laboratory](fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk). I work with the [ Jasanoff](https://jasanofflab.mit.edu/) and [Brown](https://www.neurostat.mit.edu/) labs on developing biophysical modelling of molecular fMRI. Previously, I was a Postdoctoral Researcher at the FIL, working with [Prof. Peter Zeidman](https://peterzeidman.co.uk/), [Prof. Karl Friston](https://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/~karl/), and the Memory and Space team led by [Prof. Eleanor Maguire](https://profiles.ucl.ac.uk/9569-eleanor-maguire). My long-term ambition is to understand how complex biophysical systems can instantiate and maintain functions. 

## DCM Workgroup

I chair weekly meetings that gather researchers interested in applying [Dynamic Causal Modelling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_causal_modeling) to study complex phenomenas that arise in their fields. These meetings aim at providing support to researchers trying to extend DCM to their field and at identifying the need for new method development. 

_Feel free to reach out if you are interested in attending these meetings!_

## Teaching
I teach neuroimaging methods during the bi-annual [SPM Courses](https://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/course/london/) in London. 

I am also involved in the Dynamic Causal Modelling workshop within the MSc Advanced Neuroimaging program at UCL.
 
## Training
I did my PhD in the [Interactive Digital Human team](https://www.lirmm.fr/teams-en/idh-en/) at the [LIRMM](https://www.lirmm.fr/), under [Dr. Sofiane Ramdani](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=sf56cFwAAAAJ) and [Prof. Abderrahmane Kheddar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=yd4xmlcAAAAJ). I received my MSc (*Diplôme d'Ingénieur*) in Control Engineering and Electronics from [INSA Toulouse](https://www.insa-toulouse.fr/en/).
