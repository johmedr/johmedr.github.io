I am a postdoctoral research fellow in the Methods group of the [Functional Imaging Laboratory](fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk) at UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology, working with [Dr. Peter Zeidman](https://peterzeidman.co.uk/), [Prof. Karl Friston](https://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/~karl/) and the [Memory and Space team](https://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/team/memory-space-team/) led by [Prof. Eleanor Maguire](https://profiles.ucl.ac.uk/9569-eleanor-maguire). I develop new statistical methods to help neuroscientists answer hypotheses from their neurorimaging data. My main focus is extending [Dynamic Causal Modelling](http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Dynamic_causal_modeling) to relate cortical and behavioral responses to experimental variance during naturalistic experiments. I also contribute to the development of [SPM software](https://github.com/spm).

My interests include Bayesian statistics, causal inference, dynamical systems, adaptive behavior, and specifically (but non-exhaustively): 
 - how to relate cortical computations to the updates of internal predictions or of their precision,
 - how to link these updates to behavioral responses or changes in the information content of the experimental setting,
 - how to efficiently study these updates on long temporal scales, from the order of minutes to hours, days, weeks, or even longer timescales,
 - how to model the complex circular causality emerging from the hierarchy of (cortical) closed-loop systems.
